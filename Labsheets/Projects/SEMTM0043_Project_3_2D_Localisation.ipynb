        "The 3Pi+ is equipped with 5 IR surface reflectance sensors (line sensors).  These can effectively measure the grey-scale tone of a surface.  Black surfaces reflect less IR light, whilst white surfaces reflect more IR light.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For a robot to locate itself in a 2D space, it would require 2 sources of information which could conveniently correspond to a position on an x-axis and y-axis.  A first source of information can be a gradient of grey-scale tones.  A second source of information could be the size of dots of consistent tone.  To utilise both, the robot would be required to move at a constant speed across a map that has these features on the surface:\n",

        "\n",
        "In this scenario there are several potential hypotheses in the context of a 2D localisation system that could be made the subject of investigation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gray-scale tone discrimination**: To create a useful 2D positioning system, being able to read the maximum number of discrete grey-scale tones would improve the overall spatial resolution.  There are two ways to read the line sensors - either by measuring elapsed time, or by an ADC read.  Each technique has advantages and disadvantages.  This hypothesis could investigate one, or both, looking to evidence how their characteristics can be usefully exploited.\n",
        "- **Dot size discrimination:** To create a useful 2D positioning system, being able to read the maximum number of discrete dot sizes would improve the overall spatial resolution.  In theory, dot-size can be estimated by measuring the time it takes to travel over the dot.  The IR line sensors also transmit a diffused light ray (e.g., a cone of light, not a focused laser beam).  Therefore, the line sensors can be considerd as reading an \"average\" from a 2D surface area. This has the implication that there is a \"smallest dot\" that can be reliably detected. It is should also be possible to evidence the minimum reliable difference in dot-sizes that can be detected.  To detect dot-size, dots would also need to be suitably spaced out - the spacing could be investigated and justified.\n",
        "- **Dot size and travel speed**: To estimate a dot size, it is necessary that the robot moves at a consistent speed over a dot.  There is likely a relationship between the robot travel speed and the sensor sampling (i.e. reading) time.  Clearly, moving very slowly would be effective, but the upper limit would be interesting to find and evidence.  Potential improvements may include simple filtering on the sensor response, different ways to measure the time the sensor is active, or different combinations of the 5 line sensors.\n",
        "- **Dot & Gradient Confusion:** In this proposal, two sources of information are combined in a single mark (grey-scale tone and dot-size).  However, the size of the dot is likely to also change the reflectivity of the surface, effecting the measured grey-scale tone.  In theory, smaller dots will reflect less IR light.  Therefore, to keep the two sources of information separable, it is likely that there is a minimum dot size.  It may also be necessary to \"average\" the gradient reading across the period of dot travel to make the gradient estimation more robust.  \n",
        "- **Impact of Trajectory:**  In this scenario, the robot is required to travel over dots.  Clearly, the robot will not always be aligned perfectly over the centre of a dot.  In theory, the separate information from the 5 line sensors could be used to attempt to mitigate misalignment with a dot.  Or, a high-level approach could be taken which accepts a degree of error in the readings, and attempts to process or filter out the truth over time whilst the robot moves around.\n",
